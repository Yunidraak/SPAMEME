v 1.0.0

SPAMEME is a program used to facilitate memes spam. This program
is currently only usable on windows with the Python PATH if you
have not previously installed the Python requests, pyperclip and
pyautogui libraries. It is currently usable to spam memes on
discord and whatsapp web, but only on 17-inch computers for the
latter. This program currently requires that your computer is not
used during the operation.

For more information about starting the program, use help(start).
For more information about Discord spam, use help(discord). For more
information about spam on Whatsapp Web, use help(whatsapp_web).

For more questions or comments, please use the API which is not yet
available because the developers are too lazy.
