# SPAMEME

v 1.0.1

SPAMEME is a program used to facilitate memes spam. This program is currently
only usable on windows with the Python PATH if you have not previously installed
the Python requests, pyperclip and pyautogui libraries. It is currently usable
to spam memes as urls or pictures.

This program currently requires that your computer is not used during the spam.
For more information about starting the program, use help(start). For more
information about spam, use help(spam).

For more questions or comments, please use the API which is not yet available
because the developers are too lazy.
