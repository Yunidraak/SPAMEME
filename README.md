# SPAMEME

SPAMEME is a program used to facilitate memes spam.

This program is currently only usable on windows with the Python PATH if you have not previously installed the Python requests, pyperclip and pyautogui libraries. It is currently usable to spam memes on discord and whatsapp web, but only on 17-inch computers for the latter. This program currently requires that your computer is not used during the operation.

For more questions or comments, please use the API which is not yet available because the developers are too lazy.
